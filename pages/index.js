      <p className="mb-2">Hi!</p>
      <p>I'm a Full stack web developer, sucker for knowledge and a ISFJ-T. I interned at two companies previously. I also worked full time building UI parts, fixing bugs and adding extra features at Ripple Community, I had to quit because I wanted fo focus on getting good grades but I still haven't finished my high school graduation <small className="italic">yet.</small> </p>
      <p>Currently, I am looking into open source contribution, blogging and studying full time. I still appear occasionaly on discord servers to hang out. I keep a <a href="/resources" className="linkstyle">collection of resources</a> I found over the time.</p>
      <p>During my free time, I enjoy reading books and watching movies. I also consume knowledge about various things on a weekly basis based on my current topic of interest. You can see my collections of favourite quotes <a href="/quotes" className="linkstyle">here</a>.</p>
