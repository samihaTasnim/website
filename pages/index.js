          <p>I'm a Full stack web developer, sucker for knowledge and a ISFJ-T. I interned at two companies and unfortunately none of them ended well. I also worked full time building UI parts, fixing bugs and adding extra features at Ripple Community, I had to quit because I wanted fo focus on studying. </p>
          <br />
          <p>Currently, I am getting into open source contribution, blogging and studying full time. I still appear occasionaly on discord servers and help people out. I keep a <a href="/resources">collection of resources</a> I found over the time.</p>
          <br />
          <p>During my free time, I enjoy reading and watching movies. I mainly read mangas and novels but sometimes I read other people's writings too. You can see my collections of favourite quotes from movies and books <a href="/quotes">here</a>.</p>
