      <p>
        I liked the idea of coding from when I was 14. How people would sit in front of computers and write some god forsaked language and that they result in actually good looking interfaces really amazed me. But I didn't had any computer back then so I waited for it untill I got 16. I learned HTML in 7 days after getting my first laptop and CSS in the next 15 days with the help of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> website.

        Then I googled and learned about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. I managed to finish their Responsive Web Design course. Then I heard about <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and back then they were giving out free pro-membership due to covid-19. I wrote a application and got a pro-membership like that. So I completed their Front-end Engineering path. But all this time I was only coding what they were giving instructions to. This resulted in a poor github repository. I thought they were pretty decent code examples but they didn't actually gave me professional coding taste.

        After that, I did a Complete web developement course (MERN stack) in <a href="https://web.programming-hero.com/">Programming Hero</a>. I already knew React and all of the stuff was familiar to me. But the assignments taught me a great deal of knowledge. I became creative, learned to google for my bugs and features and  did collaborative projects. They were really tough thus a great addition in my resume. Now, I still look out for opprtunities to become a better programmer by coding everyday and exploring the new modern technologies.
